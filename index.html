        <p>I have always had an interest in both creativity and logic, studying subjects at school ranging from Math, to Music and Drama.
        Led to believe that these two sides of myself were incompatible I decided to follow a creative path, specifically into the
        fashion industry.

        After leaving university I worked in Bridal Couture for over two years, but found I wasn’t entirely satisfied and moved into
        a tailoring apprenticeship on Savile row. Tailoring is a much more structured discipline and I had hoped this would suit
        ;) my more logical side.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class = 'three p'> 
        <p>
        Similar to Founders and Coders this was an intensive course with an enthusiastic group of students. I thrived in this environment
        and was singled out to begin an apprenticeship along side my studies.

        I got a lot of gratification creating a quality product which is both elegant and functional, particularly upon seeing the
        reactions of first time clients. However, part of me wished that I could be more impactful with my time as by its nature
        bespoke tailoring is not exactly scalable….

        <p>
        Having to take some time away from tailoring gave me several weeks to myself. It was during this time that a friend encouraged
        me to try coding.

        I set out to learn some of the basics, but a funny thing happened, I found that the more I learnt, the more I wanted to
        know. I soon began playing with html and css to create my own (all be it very basic) <a href='https://54m2zopkok.codesandbox.io/' target='_blank'>website</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class = 'three p'>
        <p>
        I then started on some basic javascript. In less than a month I found I had acquired so many new skills and even had a go
        at learning some React basics to build a small <a href='https://m94r5z94v8.codesandbox.io/' target='_blank'>recipe app</a>.

        Code has brought together my logical and creative sides. It has all the practicality and creativity of a craft like tailoring
        however instead of building things out of fabric and thread you can create out of pure thought. These creations have the
        potential to make a positive difference on a extensive scale.

        When I began to look for a way to break into coding Founders and Coders stood out. The sense of community you promote is
        so reassuring. I have always thrived in a diverse group environment where you can bounce ideas off one another. Helping,
        teaching and learning from my peers is the best way for me to progress.

        I have thoroughly enjoyed attending the meet ups you run on Monday and Tuesday evenings. Having the opportunity to meet
        and talk to other new coders in the same position as myself was an opportunity I could never pass up.

        I discovered this course a month before the application was due and since then I have dedicated all my time and effort to
        completing the pre-requisites and getting my coding knowledge to the expected level.

        I cannot wait to develop these new skills and begin putting them to practical use!
